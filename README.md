Google Drive Folder: bit.ly/aframecuny
Presentation: https://datavized.github.io/presentations/cuny-webxr-2019/

## Notes

### Datavized tools
Datavized tools @ TwoTone, Morph, Airfield, Geometric.

### A-frame scale
A-frame scale is in meters and so 3D model scales _should_ be built around that scale. A barrel that's 2 units tall will be a 2 meter tall barrel!

### A-frame visual inspector
The A-frame visual inspector can be accessed in an A-frame scene via ctrl+alt+i or ctrl+fn+option+i on a mac. This is a maya-like visual inspector that lets you add, translate/rotate/scale, change color etc for different entities and you can actually save the html for any new entities and add it to your scene via the clipboard button on the top right corner of the visual inspector.


### Community components
You can add an environment component with different presets from this github repo: https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component
